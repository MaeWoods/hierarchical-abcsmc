# hierarchical-abcsmc

A module built on top of abcsysbio (http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/resources/abc-sysbio/). To perform approximate Bayesian computation sequential Monte-Carlo on a hierarchical model within the abcsysbio framework.

We have applied this software on a stochastic system describing the repair of double strand breaks (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005131)
